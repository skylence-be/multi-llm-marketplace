name: solo-session-handoff-skill
description: Use PROACTIVELY when the user needs to share state across Claude sessions, hand off work to another agent, or coordinate across Solo projects. Checks Solo MCP availability first and falls back to session-handoff if offline. Triggers: 'hand off to another agent', 'save this for next session', 'shared todo', 'transfer to other project', 'scratchpad', 'lock to prevent race', 'cross-project', 'another agent needs this'. For in-conversation work only, use TaskCreate instead.

# Solo Handoff

Coordination primitives for cross-session and cross-agent state via the Solo MCP server.

## Availability check

Before doing anything else, verify Solo MCP server is reachable:

```
whoami()
```

If the call errors or times out, **stop this skill immediately** and invoke `core:session-handoff` instead. Do not attempt any other Solo MCP calls.

## When to use what

| Need | Tool |
|---|---|
| Persist structured notes for next session | `scratchpad_write` |
| Append ongoing observations | `scratchpad_append` / `scratchpad_append_section` |
| Update a specific passage | `scratchpad_edit` |
| Shared task list across agents | `todo_create` / `todo_list` |
| Mark a task done | `todo_complete` |
| Prevent concurrent writes to a shared resource | `lock_acquire` / `lock_release` |
| Move state to a different Solo project | `scratchpad_transfer` / `todo_transfer` |
| In-conversation work only | TaskCreate (built-in, not Solo) |
| Permanent user-level preferences | `~/.claude/memory/` |

## SoloTerm workflow

When working inside SoloTerm (a Solo-managed terminal session), follow this pattern:

**Session start**: check for an existing scratchpad before doing anything else:
```
scratchpad_list()               # look for a scratchpad named after the project or task
scratchpad_read(id)             # load context if one exists
todo_list()                     # check open todos before starting
```

**During work**: keep the scratchpad current:
```
scratchpad_append(id, content)                             # running notes, discoveries
scratchpad_append_section(id, "## Decisions", content)    # named section for a topic
scratchpad_edit(id, target, new_content, revision)        # replace a specific block
todo_create(title, body)                                   # track a new work item
todo_update(todo_id, body=new_body)                       # revise a todo
```

**Session end / handoff**: leave clean state for next agent:
```
scratchpad_append_section(id, "## Handoff", handoff_text) # add pick-up notes; include suggested skills
todo_complete(todo_id)                                     # close finished items
scratchpad_archive(id)                                     # archive if the work is done
```

Handoff section should include a "Suggested skills" list naming skills the next agent should invoke, and references (absolute paths or URLs) to existing plans, PRDs, or diffs rather than restating them inline.

## Scratchpad CRUD reference

### Create
```
scratchpad_write(name, content)
```
A leading `# H1` in `content` becomes the scratchpad's display title. Scope is current project unless you pass `project_id`.

### Read
```
scratchpad_read(id)             # full content
scratchpad_tail(id, lines=50)   # last N lines; faster for long pads
scratchpad_find(id, query)      # search text *within* one scratchpad
scratchpad_list()               # browse all scratchpads in the project
```

### Update
```
scratchpad_append(id, content)                              # add lines at the end
scratchpad_append_section(id, heading, content)             # add a named ## section
scratchpad_edit(id, target, content, expected_revision)     # replace a block in-place
scratchpad_clear(id)                                        # wipe content, keep metadata
scratchpad_rename(id, name)                                 # rename
scratchpad_add_tags(id, tags)                               # tag for filtering
scratchpad_remove_tags(id, tags)
```

`expected_revision` on `scratchpad_edit` is a concurrency guard; pass revision from last read. Call fails if the pad has changed since, so you don't silently overwrite concurrent writes.

### Move / export
```
scratchpad_transfer(id, target_project_id)   # move to another Solo project
scratchpad_save_to_file(id, path)            # dump to a local file
scratchpad_load_from_file(name, path)        # create a scratchpad from a file
```

### Delete
```
scratchpad_archive(id)                       # soft-delete; recoverable
scratchpad_delete(id, expected_revision)     # permanent; pass revision as safety check
```

---

## Todo lifecycle

### Create and read
```
todo_create(title, body?, tags?)    # body accepts markdown
todo_get(todo_id)                   # full detail including blockers and comments
todo_list()                         # all todos in project; filter by tag or status
```

### Update
```
todo_update(todo_id, title?, body?, ...)    # patch any field
todo_add_tag(todo_id, tag)
todo_remove_tag(todo_id, tag)
todo_comment_create(todo_id, body)          # threaded notes
todo_comment_update(comment_id, body)
todo_comment_delete(comment_id)
```

### Dependencies
```
todo_add_blocker(todo_id, blocker_todo_id)       # this todo is blocked by another
todo_remove_blocker(todo_id, blocker_todo_id)
todo_set_blockers(todo_id, [ids])                # replace full blocker set
```

Pass `response_mode: "rich"` on write ops (`todo_create`, `todo_update`, etc.) to get fully hydrated state back in response without a separate `todo_get`.

### Complete or remove
```
todo_complete(todo_id)               # mark done; stays visible in history
todo_delete(todo_id)                 # hard delete
todo_lock(todo_id)                   # exclusive write lock (multi-agent)
todo_unlock(todo_id)
```

### Cross-project
```
todo_transfer(todo_id, target_project_id)   # move to another Solo project
```

---

## Locks

Use locks when multiple agents may write to the same scratchpad or shared resource concurrently.

```
lock_acquire(key)       # block until acquired
lock_release(key)       # always release in the same session that acquired
lock_status(key)        # inspect current holder and TTL
```

Always release in the same session that acquired. A lock left unreleased persists until TTL expiry.

---

## Cross-project transfer

Resolve `target_project_id` with `list_projects` before transferring:
```
list_projects()
scratchpad_transfer(id, target_project_id)
todo_transfer(todo_id, target_project_id)
```

---

## Scratchpad content rules

1. Redact API keys, passwords, and PII; write `[REDACTED]` in place.
2. Don't re-state content already captured in plans, PRDs, ADRs, issues, or diffs; reference by absolute path or URL instead.
3. Include a "Suggested skills" section in handoff notes naming skills next agent should invoke.

---

## Handoff chain

If handing off to a freshly spawned agent, use `the Solo spawn flow (list_agent_tools -> spawn_agent -> send_input)` first to get the agent's process ID, then pass scratchpad IDs in the initial prompt so the agent can `scratchpad_read` immediately without `scratchpad_list` guesswork.
